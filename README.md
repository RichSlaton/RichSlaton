### HOW I WENT FROM A FULL-TIME MOTIVATIONAL SPEAKER TO A FULL-STACK ENGINEER

I became a speaker in 2013. I've spoken about over 1,000 events over the past eight years. I knew that I had to build my business online to scale my business. Back then, I would often tell others that I wasn't a techie and more of the artist type. 

Anyone an entrepreneur knows unless you have a pile of cashing lying around, you have to bootstrap everything. 

The rabbit hole of coding started with my desire to build online courses. First, I had to learn LMS, configure third-party apps for my projects, and discovered I had a knack for it. Fortunately, I was red-pilled into the Matrix when I needed a website created, and the programmer built it and disappeared. At first, it was a shock, anger, and once I "cooled my jets," I started looking for people to help me tweak my website, but I found myself frustrated because I couldn't find someone who could express my vision. 

Now I was convinced that I had to do it myself, so in 2015 I decided that learning some design and the basics of CSS and HTML would empower me and help create what I envisioned. It was like magic to me and felt so empowering. 

My studies started with stumbling upon UI design principles through an online course and started implementing what I learned to my W.P. site. 
The death blow to my motivational speaking happened in 2020. But, unfortunately, my story isn't unique as the whole world came to a screeching halt covid.
I did some soul searching about how financially since my speaking business was shut down. I would provide for my family.
2020 was enlightening to me. 

I had several friends who knew I built websites with W.P. and asked if I ever thought about broadening my skill set and learned how to code. 
At first, I had my reservations, but what do I have to lose? So I approached this as a full-time job and immersed myself into this world deeper. What would be the worst thing that could happen? I can add another skill set to my toolbelt.

I have a friend who was a developer who "took me under his wing," and after 300 hours of working one-on-one, I discovered that my brain enjoyed the workout. In addition, I found that coding was an extension of my creativity.

I love being able to do full-stack development in designing a UI or developing solutions on the backend. 

If you are looking for a developer for your company with my skill set or need some help on your project, let's set up a call and see if we would be a good fit. Email me at rdarbyslaton@gmail.com.
