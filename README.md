### From Painter To Hacker
My journey on this quest of the digital world began with a love for electronics. If you were to give me a choice between Radio Shack and Toys R Us, hands down, I would pick Radio Shack. I also had a great love for animation and all things art. 

My first computer was a Commodore 64 at the age of 12. You could write your program, load software from a cassette or floppy, or stick a cartridge into the back. As a family, we would create our games. However, I had some knowledge early on with computing. I found myself pursuing my art (and the dream of working for Disney) more due to some false beliefs of not being good at Math, and therefore I could never get good at computers.

Fast forward, I got into business for myself. I abandoned my art due to this fact. I didn't want to be a poor artist. I got into self-help, studied leadership, communication, and had a spiritual transformation. I became a full-time speaker and life coach. I had spoken about over 1,000 events over the past six years. I needed a website done, and the programmer built it and disappeared. I could look for someone else, or I could empower myself with learning some design and the basics of CSS and HTML to tweak it to where it looked professional. 

Covid hit the world. The pandemic shut down the world, and as well all of my speaking engagements. I did some soul searching, and several people asked me to have ever considered learning to code. At first, I had my reservations and had a friend who was a team-lead and a self-taught developer "take me under his wing." 

Most of our time over Zoom was from 5 am till 8 am. I have spent 100's of hours working one-on-one with Ryan, and he is still mentoring me. My creativity had manifested in a new way when I got rid of my child's limitations. I could now mix my love for art, animation, and design combined with the world of programming. I am a designer and a developer. I love being able to do full-stack development and create something from words.
